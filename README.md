# SpeedTest

resource dump
--had to add permissions to my manifest files and rebuild
--add dependencies
--use the developer console to get an API key for google maps
--learned how to use map fragment

--used the parcel thing to transfer arraylists between intents

--learned how to set up a first time startup deal thing

--overall: there's a surprising amount of OOP, using interfaces/extending classes?

still need to fix: getting permission, that strange integer I don't know what it does still
also still need to change how I get the API key if I ever want to deploy the app on google play
